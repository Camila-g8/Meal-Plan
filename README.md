### Tips for Muscle Gain

1. **Protein**: Aim for around 1.6 to 2.2 grams of protein per kg of bodyweight, which for you would be roughly 100 to 135 grams of protein daily.
2. **Calories**: To gain muscle, you need to be in a small caloric surplus. Start by consuming an extra 300-500 calories more than your daily needs and adjust based on your progress.
3. **Strength Training**: Incorporate strength training exercises 4-5 times per week focusing on major muscle groups.
4. **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to aid in muscle recovery and performance.
5. **Rest**: Ensure adequate sleep and recovery days, as muscle growth occurs during rest.

This meal plan provides a diversity of nutrients and enough protein essential for muscle building while adhering to vegan dietary choices. Adjustments may be necessary based on your specific calorie and nutrient needs.
